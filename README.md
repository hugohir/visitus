You are a Data Scientist for a tourism company named "Visit with us". The Policy Maker of the company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base.

A viable business model is a central concept that helps you to understand the existing ways of doing the business and how to change the ways for the benefit of the tourism sector.

One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages.

Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages.

However, it was difficult to identify the potential customers because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information.

This time company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to target the right customers.

You as a Data Scientist at "Visit with us" travel company has to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced travel package. The model will be built to make predictions before a customer is contacted.
