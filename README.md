# Travel Package Purchase Prediction

Jan 10 2023 | Hugo Hiraoka | hhiraokawatts@gmail.com

Fantasy Tours wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base.

One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages.

Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages.

However, Fantasy Tours had difficulties trying to identify the potential customers because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information.

Fantasy Tours is now planning to launch a new product i.e. Wellness Tourism Package. Wellness Tourism is defined as Travel that allows the traveler to maintain, enhance or kick-start a healthy lifestyle, and support or increase one's sense of well-being.

This time Fantasy Tours wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to target the right customers.

We will analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to Fantasy Tours and build a model to predict customers who are going to purchase the newly introduced travel package. The model will be built to make predictions before a customer is contacted.
